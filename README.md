# .NET Web API Authorization and Authentication Demo & Tutorial

Welcome to the .NET Web API Authorization and Authentication Demo & Tutorial! This repository serves as a guide and demonstration of implementing authorization and authentication mechanisms in a .NET Web API application.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide an understanding of how to integrate authorization and authentication features into .NET Web API projects.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Learn how to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication in .NET Web API application.
- **Role-based Authorization**: Explore role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific endpoints based on user roles.
- **Bearer Token Authorization**: Understand how to use bearer tokens to authenticate and authorize requests.
- **Claims**: Learn how to utilize claims to carry additional information about the user within JWTs, enabling fine-grained authorization and personalization.
- **Policies**: Define and enforce custom authorization policies to control access to resources based on various conditions and requirements.
- **Access and Refresh Tokens**: Implement access and refresh token functionality to manage user sessions securely and efficiently.
- **Redis Integration**: Utilize Redis for storing and managing access tokens, improving scalability and session management.
- **Entity Framework**: Utilize Entity Framework for data access and database management in your .NET Web API application.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Integrate PostgreSQL as the database backend for your .NET Web API application.
- **Audit Log**: Implement auditing functionality to track and log user actions such as additions, deletions, and modifications, enhancing transparency and accountability.
- **Docker Integration**: Utilize Docker for containerization to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Leverage Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container Docker applications, simplifying the deployment process.
- **Demo Application**: Get hands-on experience with a fully functional .NET Web API application showcasing these concepts.
